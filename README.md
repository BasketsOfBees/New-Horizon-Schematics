# New-Horizon-Schematics

An assortment of designs from the New Horizon community. Submit your designs to the New Horizon Discord or mindustry-tool, and they might appear here.

Some designs may vary in effectiveness and may be outdated.

This mod currently contains 36 schematics.

Deprecated, thinking about deleting. Contains schematics for the old (v147) version of New Horizon. I don't know if this works or not :/. If this doesn't work, try downloading the schematics yourself from the msch folder.
